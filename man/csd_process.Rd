\arguments{
\item{cohort}{cohort for SSDQA testing; required fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{site}
\item \code{person_id}
\item \code{start_date}
\item \code{end_date}
}}

\item{domain_tbl}{input table defining the domains listed in the annotated concept set
four columns:
- \code{domain} the name of the CDM table associated with the concept; should match what is listed in the annotated concept set
- \code{concept_field} the name of the field in the domain table where the concepts are located
- \code{date_field} the name of the field in the domain table with the date that should be used for time-based filtering
- \code{vocabulary_field} PCORnet only; set to NA}

\item{concept_set}{an annotated concept set CSV file with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{concept_id} required for OMOP; the concept_id of interest
\item \code{concept_code} required for PCORnet; the code of interest
\item \code{concept_name} optional; the descriptive name of the concept
\item \code{vocabulary_id} required for PCORnet; the vocabulary of the code - should match what is listed in the domain table's vocabulary_field
\item \code{variable} required; a string label grouping one concept code into a larger variable definition
\item \code{domain} required; the name of the CDM table where the concept is stored - multiple domains can be included in the file, but only one domain should be listed per row
}}

\item{omop_or_pcornet}{Option to run the function using the OMOP or PCORnet CDM as the default CDM
\itemize{
\item \code{omop}: run the \code{\link[=csd_process_omop]{csd_process_omop()}} function against an OMOP CDM instance
\item \code{pcornet}: run the \code{\link[=csd_process_pcornet]{csd_process_pcornet()}} function against a PCORnet CDM instance
}}

\item{multi_or_single_site}{Option to run the function on a single vs multiple sites
\itemize{
\item \code{single}: run the function for a single site
\item \code{multi}: run the function for multiple sites
}}

\item{anomaly_or_exploratory}{Option to conduct an exploratory or anomaly detection analysis. Exploratory analyses give a high
level summary of the data to examine the fact representation within the cohort. Anomaly detection
analyses are specialized to identify outliers within the cohort.}

\item{num_concept_combined}{when \code{multi_or_single_site} = \code{single} and \code{anomaly_or_exploratory} = \code{anomaly},
this argument is a boolean that will ensure that \code{concept1} and \code{concept2} meet some minimal threshold for including in the jaccard index
if \code{TRUE}, then \emph{both} conditions for \code{num_concept_1} and \code{num_concept_2} should be met; if \code{FALSE} then just one condition needs to be met.}

\item{num_concept_1}{when \code{multi_or_single_site} = \code{single} and \code{anomaly_or_exploratory} = \code{anomaly},
this argument is an integer and requires a minimum number of times that the \emph{first} concept appears in the dataset}

\item{num_concept_2}{when \code{multi_or_single_site} = \code{single} and \code{anomaly_or_exploratory} = \code{anomaly},
this argument is an integer and requires a minimum number of times that the \emph{second} concept appears in the dataset}

\item{p_value}{the p value to be used as a threshold in the multi-site anomaly detection analysis}

\item{age_groups}{If you would like to stratify the results by age group,  create a table or CSV file with the following
columns and include it as the \code{age_groups} function parameter:
\itemize{
\item \code{min_age}: the minimum age for the group (i.e. 10)
\item \code{max_age}: the maximum age for the group (i.e. 20)
\item \code{group}: a string label for the group (i.e. 10-20, Young Adult, etc.)
}

If you would \emph{not} like to stratify by age group, leave the argument as NULL}

\item{time}{logical to determine whether to output the check across time}

\item{time_span}{when time = TRUE, a vector of two dates for the observation period of the study}

\item{time_period}{when time = TRUE, this argument defines the distance between dates within the specified time period. defaults
to \code{year}, but other time periods such as \code{month} or \code{week} are also acceptable}
}
\value{
a dataframe summarizing the distribution of code usage for each user defined variable
}
\description{
This is an information representation module that will compute the distribution of concept usage in a
user-provided annotated concept set. The user will define the domains of interest (\code{domain_tbl}) and
provide the concept set to be evaluated (\code{concept_set}). Sample versions of these inputs are
included as data in the package and are accessible with \verb{conceptsetdistribution::}.
Results can optionally be stratified by site, age group, and/or time.
This function is compatible with both the OMOP and the PCORnet CDMs based on the
user's selection.
