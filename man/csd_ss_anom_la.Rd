}
\arguments{
\item{process_output}{dataframe output by \code{csd_process}}

\item{concept_col}{the name of the column from the concept_set used to identify concepts
should be either \code{concept_id} or \code{concept_code}}

\item{filtered_var}{the variable to perform the anomaly detection for}

\item{filter_concept}{the concept_id of interest for the analysis}

\item{facet}{the variables by which you would like to facet the graph; defaults to NULL}
}
\value{
if analysis was executed by year or greater, a P Prime control chart
is returned with outliers marked with orange dots
