The multi-site analyses included in this suite are intended to be executed against data that are all stored in the same place. However, there may be some instances where the data associated with each site is stored in independent locations. This vignette outlines how the multi-site analysis can be executed in these instances.

## Multi-Site Exploratory Analysis

The process for the exploratory analysis is the same for both the cross-sectional and longitudinal configurations.

First, execute the **Single Site, Exploratory, Cross-Sectional** analysis, configured appropriately for your study, against each data source.

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
library(conceptsetdistribution)

my_table <- csd_process(cohort = my_cohort,
                        multi_or_single_site = 'single',
                        anomaly_or_exploratory = 'exploratory',
                        time = T / F,
                        ...)
```

Then, combine these results into a single table with the different sites delineated in the `site` column.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_final_results <- my_table1 %>% dplyr::union(my_table2) ... %>%
  dplyr::union(my_table_n)

```

## Multi-Site Anomaly Detection Analysis

For anomaly detection analysis, start by executing the same steps as the exploratory analysis. Then, you will execute the relevant anomaly detection algorithm against the resulting table. See below for the different processes for cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis.

### Cross-Sectional

For a cross-sectional analysis, the `compute_dist_anomalies` and `detect_outliers` functions, both available through the `ssdqa.gen` package, should be executed against your results. Copy the code below, inputting the table you generated.

If using the OMOP CDM, `concept_id` should be input as the concept column. For the PCORnet CDM, `concept_code` should be input as the concept column. The `p_value` can be selected by the user.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# First execute the compute_dist_anomalies function
df_start <- compute_dist_anomalies(df_tbl = my_table,
                                   grp_vars = c('variable', concept_column),
                                   var_col = 'prop_concept',
                                   denom_cols = c('variable', 'ct_denom'))

# Then, use that output as input for the detect_outliers function
df_final <- detect_outliers(df_tbl = df_start,
                            tail_input = 'both',
                            p_input = p_value,
                            column_analysis = 'prop_concept',
                            column_variable = concept_column)

```

### Longitudinal

For a longitudinal analysis, the `ms_anom_euclidean` function, available through the `ssdqa.gen` package, should be executed against your results. Copy the code below, inputting the data you generated.

If using the OMOP CDM, `concept_id` should be input as the concept column. For the PCORnet CDM, `concept_code` should be input as the concept column.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- ms_anom_euclidean(fot_input_tbl = csd_tbl,
                        grp_vars = c('site', 'variable',
                                     concept_column),
                        var_col = 'prop_concept')

```
